# Kernel debug toolkit (Kdt)

Kdt is a toolkit for efficient kernel tracing and hotfix. It makes use of
extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters), formally known as eBPF, a new feature
that was first added to Linux 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and
above. Fortunately RHEL/CENTOS 7.6 has already supported a plenty of eBPF
features which seems keep up with Linux 4.13:

``` c
enum bpf_prog_type {
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCKET_FILTER,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_ACT,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACEPOINT,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_XDP,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_IN,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_OUT,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_XMIT,
    BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS,
};
```

So we may create and use lots of efficient tools on RHEL/CENTOS 7.6.
