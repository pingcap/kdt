Demonstrations of tcpconnect, the Linux kprobe/ftrace version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing active TCP connections
(eg, via a connect() syscall; accept() are passive connections). Some example
output (IP addresses changed to protect the innocent):

# ./tcpconnect
Tracing tcpconnect. Hit Ctrl-C to end
PID      COMM         SADDR                SPORT  DADDR                DPORT
3679     curl         192.168.60.173       48948  220.181.111.188      80
3683     curl         192.168.60.173       56770  220.181.112.244      80
3753     wrk          192.168.60.173       56772  220.181.112.244      80
3749     nginx        192.168.60.173       48954  220.181.111.188      80

This output shows four connections, one from a "wrk" process, two from
"curl", and one from "nginx". The output details shows the IP version, source
address, source port, destination address, and destination port. This traces
attempted connections: these may have failed.

The overhead of this tool should be negligible, since it is only tracing the
kernel functions performing connect. It is not tracing every packet and then
filtering.


The -t option prints a timestamp column:

# ./tcpconnect -t
Tracing tcpconnect. Hit Ctrl-C to end
TIME(s)      PID      COMM         SADDR                SPORT  DADDR                DPORT

91.723584    3807     wrk          192.168.60.173       56882  220.181.112.244      80
91.749349    3809     wrk          192.168.60.173       49064  220.181.111.188      80
91.776038    3807     wrk          192.168.60.173       56886  220.181.112.244      80

The output shows some periodic connections (or attempts) from a "wrk"
process to various other addresses. A few connections occur every minute.


USAGE message:

# ./tcpconnect -h
usage: tcpconnect [-h] [-t] [-p PID] [-P PORT]

Trace TCP connects

optional arguments:
  -h    show this help message and exit
  -t    include timestamp on output
  -p    trace this PID only
  -P    comma-separated list of destination ports to trace.

examples:
    ./tcpconnect           # trace all TCP connect()s
    ./tcpconnect -t        # include timestamps
    ./tcpconnect -p 181    # only trace PID 181
    ./tcpconnect -P 80     # only trace port 80
    ./tcpconnect -P 80,81  # only trace port 80 and 81
