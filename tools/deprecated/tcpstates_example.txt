Demonstrations of tcpstates, the Linux kprobe/ftrace version.


tcpstates prints TCP state change information, including the duration in each
state as milliseconds. For example, a single TCP session:

# ./tcpstates

This showed that the most time was spent in the CLOSE state (which then
transitioned to SYN_SENT), which was 4418.078 milliseconds.

The first column is the socked address, as the output may include lines from
different sessions interleaved. The next two columns show the current on-CPU
process ID and command name: these may show the process that owns the TCP
session, depending on whether the state change executes synchronously in
process context. If that's not the case, they may show kernel details.


USAGE:

# tcpstates -h
usage: tcpstates [-h] [-T] [-t]

Trace TCP session state changes and durations

optional arguments:
  -h    show this help message and exit
  -T    include time column on output (HH:MM:SS)
  -t    include timestamp on output (seconds)

examples:
    ./tcpstates           # trace all TCP state changes
    ./tcpstates -t        # include timestamp column
    ./tcpstates -T        # include time column (HH:MM:SS)
